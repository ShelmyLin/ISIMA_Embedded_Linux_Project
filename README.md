ISIMA_Embedded_Linux_Project
============================

The goal of the project is the realization of a low-cost dedicated central monitoring and remote control of an application. Such an implementation can be used for various applications: robotic automation, remote monitoring, telemedicine etc. The central collects data from various sensors (environmental data) connected to the local server (RASPBERRY-PI board) through the RS232 serial port. For internet connection, the http APACHE2 server is installed on the RASPBERRY-PI board. Therefore, it is possible to monitor an application remotely by using a PC, Smartphone or xPAD through the internet
